**Robotanist** is an Autonomous & Remote Monitoring Control Unit (ARMCU) designed to bridge the gap between high-tech industrial farming and personal urban food security. Functioning as a compact "smart factory" for living food, it automates the transport, monitoring, and harvesting of microgreens within a vertical tower.
